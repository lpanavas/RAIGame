      <h1>Welcome to the AI Regulation Game!</h1>
      <p>
        The European Union has just passed the AI Act, a significant regulation
        on AI technology, aimed at ensuring safe and lawful use of AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this game, you'll be required to categorize different uses of AI into
        three groups:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Never Allowed</strong>: These are applications of AI that are
          completely banned under the AI Act due to potential harm or violation
          of human rights.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>High Risk</strong>: These AI applications are not banned, but
          are subject to strict regulatory requirements due to their potential
          to cause harm or adverse impact.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Low Risk</strong>: These are AI applications that pose minimal
          risk to individual rights or safety and have less stringent regulatory
          requirements.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        For every correctly placed AI use case, you'll earn points. The base
        score is 10 points, and you'll earn an additional 2 points for each card
        already in the bucket. However, if you place a use case in the wrong
        category, you'll receive a penalty which subtracts from your total
        score. The base penalty is 20 points, and you'll lose an additional 4
        points for each card already in the bucket.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your objective is to maximize your score by accurately categorizing as
        many AI use cases as possible. Remember, once you place a card in a
        bucket, you cannot move it. Choose wisely and good luck!
